Building from source
====================

Only tested on Mac OS

It is a lot easier to just use Xcode and open the Xcode project file and build from there.

If the Xcode console doesn't respond to the enter key, open the generated executable directly.

If the are linking errors, then the OpenAL.framework is not imported in the project.
It must be added to the Link Binary with libraries Build Phase.

If there is no sound, remember to point the base_path of SSoundMaster (in ssound.h) to the appropiated absolute path.
